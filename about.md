Hello, my name is Cody. I don't think there is much to say about me aside from me being an IT oriented fella that likes to see how things move and interact.

I am a self defined security researcher and vulnerability explorer, practicing with CtFs and vulnerable machines to better understand the threat landscape that we live with.

I typically fall into random solutions to problems as I move along and never really know how I get there.

Perhaps something I type in this blog will give someone a solution, and if that is you than I am glad I could help.

### More Information

I am just a dork/nerd/geek who likes to tinker with things. Thats really all there is to me.
